            <h4>HOW TO MAKE RUSTIC CRUSTY BREAD</h4>
            <div>
                <ul><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
                    <li>3 cups warm water, about 100 degrees</li>
                    <li>1 ½ tablespoons instant yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>6 ½ cups (923 g) unbleached, all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting dough</li>
                </ul>
                <ol><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b>
                    <li>In a large bowl mix yeast and salt into 3 cups lukewarm water (about 100 degrees). 
                        Stir in flour, mixing until there are no dry patches. Dough will be quite loose. Cover 
                        lightly with a kitchen towel but don’t seal the bowl airtight. Let the dough rise at room 
                        temperature 2 hours (or up to 5 hours).</li>
                    <li>Bake at this point or refrigerate, covered in an airtight container, for as long as two weeks. 
                        When ready to bake, cut off a grapefruit-size piece with serrated knife (I have only ever made 
                        two loaves out of the batch of dough so I just divide the dough in half to form my first loaf). 
                        Turn the dough in your hands to lightly stretch the surface, creating a rounded top and a lumpy 
                        bottom. Put the dough on a piece of parchment paper set on a pizza peel or a rimmed baking sheet 
                        turned upside down.</li> 
                    <li>Slashing: you can dust the top of the dough lightly with flour and slash now (before rising) or wait
                         until after the loaf has risen. I’ve found waiting and slashing the dough after rising can sometimes 
                         cause the loaf to collapse, so after making this bread for years, my preferred method is to dust the 
                         top of the loaf lightly with flour at this step, before rising, and slash the top with a baker’s lame 
                         or sharp knife 3-4 times.</li>    
                    <li>Let the dough rest for 40 minutes for room temperature dough; if you have used the dough out of the 
                        refrigerator, let it rest for 1 1/2 hours. Repeat with remaining dough or refrigerate it.</li>
                    <li>Place a broiler pan on the bottom rack of the oven (if you don’t have a broiler pan – no worries! Tossing 
                        5-6 ice cubes in the bottom of the oven when you put in the bread works really well, too). Place a baking 
                        stone on the middle rack and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat the stone at that temperature for 20 minutes 
                        before baking.</li>      
                    <li>After the dough has rested and is ready to bake, if you haven’t already (see step #3), dust the dough lightly 
                        with flour, slash the top with serrated or very sharp knife three times</li>
                    <li>Slide the dough (with the parchment paper) onto the baking stone. Pour one cup of hot water into the broiler 
                        pan (or toss 5-6 ice cubes in the bottom of the oven) and shut the oven quickly but gently to trap the steam. 
                        Bake the bread until well browned, about 24-28 minutes. Cool completely.</li>
