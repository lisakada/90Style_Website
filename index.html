        <p style="color: rgb(47, 9, 184);"><br>DID YOU KNOW?<br><i>The earliest known form of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains, 
            soaked them in water, and mashed the mixture into a kind of broth-like paste. The paste was cooked by 
            pouring it onto a flat, hot rock, resulting in a bread-like substance. Later, when humans mastered fire, 
            the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, as it could now be made any time fire 
            was created. The world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago.</i></p>
